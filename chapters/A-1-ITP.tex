The code we used is the 4He-DFT BCN-TLS \cite{BCNcode}.
A detailed description is provided in \cite{DFTguide}. 
We give here the most important features about the computational approach. 
Equations are solved on a real space cubic grid.
In order to compute the convolution products involved in the functional, we also work in \textsc{Fourier}'s space, which is why we use a cubic mesh. 

\section{Imaginary time propagation}
\label{sec:ANX-itp}

In order to find ground state properties we have to minimize a \textsc{Schr√∂dinger}-like equation. 
Let us consider that we know the eigenvectors $\{\phi_k\}$ of the given Hamiltonian with energies $\{\varepsilon_k\}$
\begin{align}
H \phi_k = \varepsilon_k \phi_k 
\end{align}

Since $H$ does not depend on time, one can formally write the propagation in time of a given $\psi$ as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ITP}
i\hbar \pdv{t} \psi &= H\psi \Rightarrow \psi(t) = \e^{-i\frac{t}{\hbar} H} \, \psi(0)
\end{align}

Let us now introduce an \textit{imaginary time} as $\tau = i t/\hbar$ and rewrite (\citeq{eq:ITP}) as a function of $\tau$
\begin{align}
i\hbar \pdv{\tau} \dv{\tau}{t} \psi &= H \psi \Rightarrow \pdv{\tau} \psi = - H \psi \Rightarrow \psi(\tau) = \e^{- \tau H } \, \psi(0)
\end{align}

We expand $\psi(0)$ in the basis $H$ eigenvectors
\begin{align}
\psi(0) = \sum_{k=0}^{k=\infty} \alpha_k \phi_k \quad \text{and} \quad H \phi_k = \varepsilon_k \phi_k \Rightarrow \psi(\tau) = \sum_{k=0}^{k=\infty} \alpha_k \, \e^{-\tau \varepsilon_k }  \, \phi_k 
\label{eq:ITP-dead}
\end{align}

What we see in \citeq{eq:ITP-dead}, is that upon propagation with  imaginary time, only the ground state survives. In practice to compute $\psi(\tau)$ we use 
\begin{align}
\psi(\tau+\delta \tau) \approx (1-\delta \tau H) \, \psi(\tau) \equiv \psi(\tau) + \delta \psi(\tau)
\end{align}

This expression is iterated until convergence, which gives the ground state eigenvector and  its associated eigenvalue
\begin{align}
\varepsilon_0 = \frac{\bra{\Psi}H\ket{\Psi}}{\braket{\Psi}{\Psi}}
\end{align}
