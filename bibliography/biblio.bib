Each cluster contains, on average, less than one dopant atom. Both excitation and emission spectra have been recorded. The observed excitation spectra are analyzed, calculating the transitions within an approach based on the hypothesis that the chromophores are trapped in a dimple on the cluster's surface as predicted by the theoretical calculations of Ancilotto et al. [9]. The results of the model calculations are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental findings. In spite of the very weak binding energy (a few cm−1), some of the excited atoms remain bound to the surface, provided the excitation occurs at frequencies not too far from the alkali's gas phase absorptions. These bound-bound excitations produce very broad, red shifted emission spectra. At other, blue shifted frequencies, the excited atoms desorb from the cluster's surface, giving rise to unshifted, free atom, emission spectra. The heavier alkali metals (Na, K) show, compared to the calculations, an additional broadening which is attributed to surface excitations on the helium droplet.",

abstract  ="The dynamics following the photoexcitation of Na and Li atoms located on the surface of helium nanodroplets has been investigated in a joint experimental and theoretical study. Photoelectron spectroscopy has revealed that excitation of the alkali atoms via the (n + 1)s ? ns transition leads to the desorption of these atoms. The mean kinetic energy of the desorbed atoms{,} as determined by ion imaging{,} shows a linear dependence on excitation frequency. These experimental findings are analyzed within a three-dimensional{,} time-dependent density functional approach for the helium droplet combined with a Bohmian dynamics description of the desorbing atom. This hybrid method reproduces well the key experimental observables. The dependence of the observables on the impurity mass is discussed by comparing the results obtained for the 6Li and 7Li isotopes. The calculations show that the desorption of the excited alkali atom is accompanied by the creation of highly non-linear density waves in the helium droplet that propagate at supersonic velocities."}

	abstract = {When physicists rotate the superfluid 4He, it develops a regular array of tiny whirlpools, called vortices. The same phenomenon should occur in helium droplets half a micrometer in size, but studying individual droplets is tricky. Gomez et al. used x-ray diffraction to deduce the shape of individual rotating droplets and image the resulting vortex patterns, which confirmed the superfluidity of the droplets. They found that superfluid droplets can host a surprising number of vortices and can rotate faster than normal droplets without disintegrating.Science, this issue p. 906 Helium nanodroplets are considered ideal model systems to explore quantum hydrodynamics in self-contained, isolated superfluids. However, exploring the dynamic properties of individual droplets is experimentally challenging. In this work, we used single-shot femtosecond x-ray coherent diffractive imaging to investigate the rotation of single, isolated superfluid helium-4 droplets containing ~108 to 1011 atoms. The formation of quantum vortex lattices inside the droplets is confirmed by observing characteristic Bragg patterns from xenon clusters trapped in the vortex cores. The vortex densities are up to five orders of magnitude larger than those observed in bulk liquid helium. The droplets exhibit large centrifugal deformations but retain axially symmetric shapes at angular velocities well beyond the stability range of viscous classical droplets.},

abstract="Alkali atoms have been shown previously to have only unstable binding states inside liquid4He. We calculate the equilibrium configurations and binding energies of single alkali atoms near the liquid-vapor interface of4He and3He. A simple interface model is used to predict the surface deformation due to the presence of the atoms. A more realistic density functional model yields somewhat higher energies in the case of4He. For all alkali atoms, we find the surface binding energies to be around 10 to 20 K. A similar analysis with atom-H2 interactions finds that alkali atoms tend to submerge into liquid H2, with the exception of Li.",
